DEVELOPER PORTFOLIO

ABOUT ME

Hey, my name is Jonathan Nunez. I live in Bronx, New York and I currently build IOS apps using swift. I knew that app/web development was my calling when I had to choose a minor degree to go with my business major in College in 2018. I chose to go with computer science and it has changed my life ever since. I was exposed to C# and learnt a bit of history behind the technology world and how it was shaped from the very beginning. Since then I've been fascinated and passionate about being an architect in the technology world that evolves day by day. I am evolving everyday and looking for ways to further develop my skills. 

PROJECTS

TreatMe: This is my first big project under my belt, other than other minor apps that I’ve created in the past in which I programmed just to practice certain fields of swift and/or reading/writing, etc to databases. This app focuses on making “everything medical” simpler for the user. From registering your appointment with the required information tailored to the medical facility, to reminders with notifications. For example: reminders for going a jog on weekdays in the morning or medications that you might need to take whether it be daily, weekly, or biweekly. TreatMe brings advantages to not only the patients but also to the medical facilities when it comes to administering these patients and their appointments. It knocks out some steps, where the app handles creating these appointments and gathering information for them. All that's left for the patient to do is show up. I focused highly on making the app as simple to use as possible. Not just for the patient but for the facilities as well. This project is still in the making, but I’ve decided to be transparent with my work. Therefore, every commit shows my progress day by day.

In this project written in Swift I used:
- Xcode
- UIkit
- Firebase
- Log in system
- User authentication/roles (Admin/ Basic user)
- Messaging system
- CocoaPods
- Clean code
- Error handling
- Sketch 
- and a couple more contributing components. For more info check out my TreatMe-Official- repository.
