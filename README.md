DEVELOPER PORTFOLIO

ABOUT ME

Hey, my name is Jonathan Nunez. I live in Bronx, New York and I currently build IOS apps using swift. I knew that app/web development was my calling when I had to choose a minor degree to go with my business major in College in 2018. I chose to go with computer science and it has changed my life ever since. I was exposed to C# and learnt a bit of history behind the technology world and how it was shaped from the very beginning. Since then I've been fascinated and passionate about being an architect in the technology world that evolves day by day. I am evolving everyday and looking for ways to further develop my skills. 

PROJECTS

TreatMe: This is my first big project under my belt, other than other minor apps that I’ve created in the past in which I programmed just to practice certain fields of swift and/or reading/writing, etc to databases. This app focuses on making “everything medical” simpler for the user. From registering your appointment with the required information tailored to the medical facility, to reminders with notifications. 

In this project written in Swift I used:
- Xcode
- UIkit
- Storyboards
- Firebase
- Log in system
- User authentication/roles (Admin/ Basic user)
- Notifications
- Messaging system
- CocoaPods
- Clean code
- Error handling
- Sketch 
- and a couple more contributing components. For more info check out my TreatMe-Official- repository.
